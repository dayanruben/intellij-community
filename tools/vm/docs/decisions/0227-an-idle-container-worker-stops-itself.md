# 227. An idle Apple container worker stops itself

Date: 2026-10-10

## Status

Accepted. It amends [ADR 0106](0106-a-warm-daemon-survives-a-lease-release.md) on the Apple `container` engine only:
there the warm daemon survives a release until the idle deadline, and not until `pool stop`. The number follows
[ADR 0226](0226-the-container-pool-follows-the-host-memory-and-the-builder-stops.md), which skips 0225 for the reason
that it states.

## Context

A lease release keeps the container and its warm daemon (ADR 0106), so the next run of the same lane pays no daemon
start. The worker runs until a `pool stop`.

On Apple `container`, the default engine of a macOS 26 Mac (ADR 0224), each worker is a VM of 8192 MiB that returns no
memory to the host until it stops (ADR 0222, item 7). ADR 0226 lets a large host run four or more such workers. A
developer who ran a lane in the morning held 8 GiB or more of the host for the rest of the day.

The controller is a command line. No resident process can count an idle period after the release.

The user asked on 2026-10-10 for an idle worker on Apple `container` that stops itself after a grace period. The user
chose a grace of one hour on the same day.

## Decision

1. **`AIR_VM_IDLE_STOP` sets the grace, in seconds, or `off`.** The default is 3600 s (`IDLE_STOP_DEFAULT`) on Apple
   `container`. Every other engine and backend reads `off`: a container stop on the Lima engine frees nothing, an
   external engine belongs to the operator, and a Tart worker suspends with `pool stop`. `0` stops the worker inside
   the release. A malformed value is `invalid_environment` on every pool.
2. **A release writes a record and starts a detached process.** After the lease goes, `Manager::schedule_idle_stop`
   writes `<runtime root>/workers/<worker>/idle-stop.json` with `schemaVersion`, `worker`, `releasedAt`, `deadline`
   and a `nonce`. It then starts `<controller> --backend docker pool idle-stop <worker> --nonce <nonce>` in a session of
   its own, through `Runner::spawn_session`, with its output in `idle-stop.log` beside the record. That is the start of
   the detached trace viewer too. The reply of the release gains `idleStopAt`, the deadline.
3. **`pool idle-stop` is a hidden verb.** It reads the record every 30 s (`IDLE_STOP_POLL`), and it exits at once when
   the record is gone or has another nonce. At the deadline it decides under the lifecycle lock of the worker
   (`Manager::idle_stop_worker`):
   - a record that is gone or has another nonce means that a later operation took the slot, so it exits;
   - a lease means that a holder took the worker, so it exits;
   - otherwise it stops the container through `stop_without_lifecycle_lock`, and the record goes.

   A lifecycle lock that another operation holds makes it ask again after the same pause. The engine is reached and
   never started (`Docker::reach_engine`), so a server that is down stops nothing.
4. **A lease acquisition and a start remove the record.** `place_lease` removes it under the lifecycle lock, and so
   does `start_docker`. So a worker that a holder takes before the deadline keeps running, and the waiting process
   finds no record.
5. **The next run starts the worker again.** `require_docker_ready` starts a stopped container, as before. The data
   volume keeps the staged runtime, so the next run pays the start and a cold daemon, and no staging.
6. **`status` names the deadline.** A worker with a record has ` idle_stop=<deadline>` on its line and `idleStopAt` in
   its row.
7. **The fixtures turn it off.** The host testkit sets `AIR_VM_IDLE_STOP=off` on every Apple `container` pool, so no
   suite starts a detached process. The worker fixture records the start request instead, and a suite of the idle stop
   sets the grace.

## Consequences

- **An idle worker gives its memory back after an hour.** The worker after a lane run in the morning holds no memory in
  the afternoon.
- **A run after the deadline pays a cold daemon.** The container start takes about 1 s, and the daemon start with a
  staged runtime took 11.7 s on 2026-10-09 (ADR 0222). A developer who runs a lane less often than once an hour pays it
  each time. `AIR_VM_IDLE_STOP=off` keeps the old behaviour.
- **Each release starts one small process.** A later release or acquisition makes the earlier process exit within 30 s.
- **The process outlives the controller and the terminal.** It inherits the environment of the controller without the
  bridge credentials, as the viewer does, so it resolves the same pool.
- **A `vm.cmd` rebuild does not change a waiting process.** The process runs the binary of the release that started
  it.

## Alternatives rejected

- **A resident pool daemon on the host.** It is a new long-lived process with its own state, start and update. The
  detached process lives only for the grace.
- **A `launchd` timer.** It needs a plist per host and works on macOS only, and the controller starts no installation.
- **Stop the worker at every release.** A run of the same lane a minute later then pays a cold daemon each time.
- **An idle stop on every engine.** On the Lima engine the engine VM keeps its memory, so a container stop frees
  nothing.
