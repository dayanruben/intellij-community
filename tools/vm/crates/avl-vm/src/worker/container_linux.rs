//! The container-linux backend: the `container.cmd` script of the `testing-ui` skill, against the one container of this
//! checkout.
//!
//! A container-linux worker is the Linux guest of the skill's image. The script starts the container and mounts the
//! two read-only shares at their host paths; the guest writes the control port and its bearer into the skill's output
//! root, `out/testing-ui`. The runtime's exec serves the developer terminal of `exec` in text mode and `pull`. Every
//! other guest command goes through the control port
//! ([`ControlPortChannel`](crate::worker::channel::ControlPortChannel)). The guest runs as the one unprivileged
//! account of the image.
//!
//! Smaller than the Docker backend: the script owns the image, the container name and the ports, and `list` is the
//! one question about liveness.
