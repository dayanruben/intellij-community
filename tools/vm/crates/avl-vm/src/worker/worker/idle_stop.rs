//! The idle stop of a worker on the Apple `container` engine ([`Config::idle_stop`]).
//!
//! The controller is a command line with no resident process. So a lease release writes a record with a deadline
//! and starts a detached `pool idle-stop` process. That process waits for the deadline and then stops the container
//! when no lease took the worker. A lease acquisition and a start remove the record, so the process then finds no
//! record of its nonce and exits.
