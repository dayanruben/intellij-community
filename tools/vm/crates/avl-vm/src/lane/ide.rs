//! The lane IDEs that the guest agent runs beside the daemon: where their contexts are, the stop of the IDEs that a
//! worker must not keep, and the check that no IDE runs from the shares.
//!
//! The daemon decides when an IDE starts, and the guest agent owns the process. Each IDE is a supervisor run in the
//! slot root of its context, `<vm_data>/ide/<launchKey>`. A cancel of the daemon run does not stop it. So the
//! controller stops the IDEs itself where the daemon cannot: at `daemon stop`, at a lease release, at a pool recycle
//! and at a daemon start.
