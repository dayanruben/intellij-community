//! The host-side fixtures the controller's suites share: `avl-vm` lists this crate as a dev-dependency, and no crate
//! lists it as a normal one.
//!
//! What is here stands on `avl-host-sys` and below, never on `avl-vm`. A crate cannot take a dev-dependency on a
//! crate that depends on it: the fixture would link the normal `avl_vm`, and the controller suite's own is the one
//! compiled with `cfg(test)`, so the two `Manager` types would differ. So each module assembles its `Manager` itself,
//! in its own `cfg(test)` module, over [`HostPool`] and [`FakeGuests`]. `avl-host-sys` keeps a minimal fake channel
//! of its own for the same reason.
//!
//! The host process table of a probe is [`FakeProcesses`] for a suite that gives one to its runner.
//!
//! The hypervisor is [`avl_testkit::tartfake`]'s fake, and the host `git` is [`FakeGit`]. On Unix both are shell
//! scripts. A Windows host runs no shell script and has the Docker backend only, so there the fake `docker` and the
//! fake `git` are the program of [`avl_testkit::fakebin`], and a pool of another backend does not load.
