//! The runfiles of a runtime descriptor on the host, and where a worker opens them.
//!
//! On a macOS or a Linux host Bazel builds `<descriptor>.runfiles`, a tree of links into the checkout and the output
//! root, and the host reads a runfile under that tree. On a Windows host Bazel writes the MANIFEST of the descriptor
//! and no tree, and the host reads a runfile at its MANIFEST target. The choice is made on what is on disk, not on the
//! host OS.
//!
//! The guest agent builds its own tree from the MANIFEST on every host, with the `runfiles-tree` verb
//! ([`Guest::ensure_runfiles_tree`](crate::guest::Guest::ensure_runfiles_tree)), under
//! [`guest_runfiles_destination`], at `<destination>/<digest>`. No share holds the checkout, so a runfile whose host
//! file lies in the checkout is a staged runfile: the host sends its bytes, and the tree holds a copy
//! ([`HostRunfiles::guest_tree`]). The digest is a function of the request, so the host names the root before the
//! guest has built it.
