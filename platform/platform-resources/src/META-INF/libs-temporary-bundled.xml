      Currently used only by DBE (see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-211789/CNFE-org.codehaus.jettison.mapped.Configuration).
      Declared as a dependency of xstream because xstream technically depends on it.
      Marked as `embedded`: since xstream depends on it, this module must be embedded as well.
      No other module should require jettison when using xstream; in general, avoid using xstream at all.
