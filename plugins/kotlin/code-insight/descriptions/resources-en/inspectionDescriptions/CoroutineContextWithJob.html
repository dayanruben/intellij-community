Reports coroutine builders calls that violate structured concurrency by accepting a <code>CoroutineContext</code> containing a
<code>Job</code>.
<p>
  Passing contexts with a <code>Job</code> to coroutine builders like <code>launch</code>, <code>async</code>, <code>produce</code>, <code>promise</code>,
  or to <code>withContext</code>
  breaks the parent-child relationship between coroutines, defeating the purpose of structured concurrency.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
coroutineScope.launch(Job()) {
  // this coroutine does not have parent relationship with the `coroutineScope` receiver 
}
</code></pre>
